Stan is a high-level programming language that can be used for sampling from the posterior distribution of a statistical model. It provides a flexible and efficient means the for inference of Bayesian models. Stan generates samples from the posterior of a defined statistical model utilizing Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling, and more specifically its the Hamiltonian Monte Carlo variant which is a highly effective variant of MCMC. 


Follow the instruction at https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/ to install Stan on your local computer. 


## Basic program structure

- Write the program in a separate text file

- Call Stan from R, command line, or several other languages. This creates a collection of posterior samples. 

- Analyse the posterior samples with tools presented in the previous episode. 


Next, let's write the models we have previously worked with in Stan. 

## Example 1: Binomial model

A Stan program is structured into several blocks that define the statistical model and specify the algorithm for inference. A Stan program typically (but not necessarily) includes the following blocks:

1. Data block: This block is used to declare the input data fed into the model. It specifies the types and dimensions of the data variables used in the model.

2. Parameters block: In this block, the model's parameters, that are inferred, are declared. 

3. Model block: The model block contains the specification of the statistical model, consisting of the likelihood and the prior distributions. 



```stan
  data{
    int<lower=1> N; 
    int<lower=0> x; 
  }
  
  parameters{
    real<lower=0, upper=1> p;
  }
  
  model{
    
    // Likelihood
    x ~ binomial(N, p);
    
    // Uniform prior for p
    
  }
```

Notice that the types of each data variable and parameter needs to be specified. Moreover, it is helpful to specify the ranges the variables can get. For example, a variable that can only get positive values can be specified with a `<lower=0>` after the type specification. 

The sampling statement `x ~ binomial(N, p);` in the model block defines that the likelihood for the data is the binomial distribution. No prior distribution is specified for the parameter $p$ which implicitly imposes a uniform distribution. 
 
Next, let's define the data as a list and then call the Stan program. 


```r
binom_data <- list(N = 50, x = 7)

binom_samples <- sampling(binomial_model, binom_data)
```

```{.output}

With the default setting Stan runs 4 MCMC chains with 2000 iterations (more about this in Episode 5 on MCMC). Running `binom_samples` prints a posterior summary for the model parameter $p$ that allows you to quickly review the results. 


```r
binom_samples
```

```{.output}
Inference for Stan model: anon_model.

Samples were drawn using NUTS(diag_e) at Mon Nov  6 16:39:09 2023.
For each parameter, n_eff is a crude measure of effective sample size,
and Rhat is the potential scale reduction factor on split chains (at 
convergence, Rhat=1).
```

This summary can also be accessed as a matrix with `summary(binom_samples)$summary`.

Often, however, it is necessary to work with the individual samples. These can be extracted as follows:


```r
p_samples <- extract(binom_samples, "p")[["p"]]
```

Now we can use the methods presented in the previous Episode to compute posterior summaries, credible intervals and to generate figures. 


:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge

(Revision)

Compute the 95% credible intervals for the samples drawn with Stan. What is the probability that $p \in [0.05, 0.15]$? Plot a histogram of the posterior samples. 


::::::::::::::::::::: solution


```r
CI95 <- quantile(p_samples, probs = c(0.025, 0.975))
p_between_0.05_0.15 <- mean(p_samples>0.05 & p_samples<0.15)


p <- ggplot(data = data.frame(p = p_samples)) +
  geom_histogram(aes(x = p), bins = 30) +
  coord_cartesian(xlim = c(0, 1))


print(p)
```

:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::: challenge
It recommended that the Stan program is specified in a separate text file that is then called from R. Copy the binomial model from above into a text file and save it as `binomial.stan`. Then call it from R with `binomial_model <- stan_model("binomial.stan")` and generate samples with `rstan::sampling(binomial_model, stan_data)`.

Try setting a $Beta$ prior for p. 

Can you modify the Stan program further so that you can set the hyperparameters $\alpha, \beta$ as part of the data? What is the benefit of using this approach?


::::::::::::::::::::: solution

If the data block is modified so that it declares the hyperparameters as data (e.g. `real<lower=0> alpha;`), it enables setting the hyperparameter values as part of data. This way several hyperparameters can be tried out quickly, without modifying the Stan file.

Let's use this Stan program to fit the handedness data encountered in the previous episodes.

## Example 2: normal model

Next, let's implement the normal model in Stan. First generate some data with unknown mean and standard deviation parameters $\mu$ and $\sigma$


```r
# Sample size
N <- 99

# Generate data with unknown parameters
unknown_sigma <- runif(1, 0, 10)
unknown_mu <- runif(1, -5, 5)

X <- rnorm(n = N,
           mean = unknown_mu,
           sd = unknown_sigma) 
```


Then the stan program, which the following piece of code stores as `normal_model`.


```stan

data {
  int<lower=0> N;
  vector[N] X;
}

parameters {
  real mu;
  real<lower=0> sigma;
}

model {
  
  // likelihood is vectorized!
  X ~ normal(mu, sigma);
  
  // Priors
  mu ~ normal(0, 1);
  sigma ~ gamma(2, 1);
  
}

```


Notice that the likelihood in the model block is vectorized. Alternatively, one could write a for loop that samples each data point individually from the likelihood: `X[i] ~normal(\mu, \sigma)`. This would be an inefficient way of implementing the likelihood function and vectorization is recommended. However, when writing complex models it may be useful to initially write the model in an unvectorized format so debugging is easier.  

Let's again fit the model on the data 


```r
# Call Stan
normal_samples <- rstan::sampling(normal_model, 
                                  list(N = N, X = X))
```

```{.output}
